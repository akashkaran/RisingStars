Copy entire folder as it is!

csv contains all required csv's
source contains packages n libraries 

icc.py => for top100 pl list in csv
relrank.py =>calculates n stores ranks in icc_nb list
graph_ip.py =>takes i/p from nbresult,cartresult,icctop100 csv n produces graph_ip.csv which is then converted to graph_ip.js 
index.html => takes data from graph_ip.js n displays it in canvas of html

relrank.py,graph_ip.py both requires k.py(source/k.py) to work!
